                    <p class="card-text">Hello, my name is Sasa, and i love to call myself Web Developer, altough I am not one (YET!). Two years ago I started learning to code, focusing both on front and back-end development. As you can assume, I had the first encounter with programming at ICT College. I have done multiple web projects by myself and realized that I am really passionate about programming. I am 100% sure that I want to build a successful career in IT, because it is fulfilling, and it makes me happy. If you want to know more things about me, feel free to check out <a href="https://spajovic.netlify.app/"> my portfolio page</a></p>
